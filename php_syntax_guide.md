# PHP Comments

Comments are text that php will ignore.

```
//This text will be ignored 

/*This text will be ignored*/
```

# PHP Variables

A variable is a label on some data. A variable stores the data assigned to it, and is interchangeable with that data.

In php, variables are assigned and called using the `$` symbol.

Variables can be assigned to any kind of data in php. 

```
$a_string = "hello";
$an_int = 2;
$a_float = 1.1;

// And so on

$added = $an_int + $a_float; // The same as: 2 + 1.1

```

# PHP Echo / Print

`echo` and `print` are functions built into php which display text onto the page 

`echo` has no return value, and is slightly faster than `print`. `print` will always return 1.
